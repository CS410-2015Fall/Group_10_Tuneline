# Tuneline
## What is our project?
*Tuneline* chronicles your auditory life. You can add (or “link”) an audio piece (or “soundbite”), be it recorded from your mobile device or sounds from the web, into one continuous timeline (or “tuneline”). Additionally, you can sync parts of your “tuneline” with your friends by tagging them in a “soundbite”. Finally, you can make playlists and re-enjoy your life through sound. 

## Why is is interesting?
Humans have a remarkable ability to associate specific sounds or music to a past moment in their life. With *Tuneline*, you can now link these memory-evoking soundbites to a tuneline of your life – past or present – and play them back and re-live those emotional moments. Imagine being at your favourite band’s concert and saving some audio pieces of their performance; relive your cheers in UBC imagine day; hear your child cry for the first time as they are being brought into this world. *Tuneline* will save those moments for you building an auditory story of your life. 
One could argue that video does a better job at recording life’s moments, but video is more intrusive and can disrupt the moment for you and others. In terms of re-living the moment, sound can be an excellent alternative.
Along with syncing with friends, soundbites can shared to the public so that everyone can live your experiences. This could eventually be a platform for artists and musicians where they could share songs they are working on or songs that are inspiring them for all of their fans to listen to.

## Why does this project make sense in a mobile form factor?
	* We have mobile devices with us all the time
	* All mobile devices have a microphone and speakers
	* Each smartphone can connect to the internet for sharing
	* Large touch displays allow users to interact with their tuneline
	* Mobile devices allow rich collection of metadata which is used for searching soundbites
